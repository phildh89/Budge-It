<br/>
*	Did you complete all items in your sprint plan?<br/>
No, the tasks I made were too big for me to learn and implement in a few days<br/>
*	What is your sprint deliverable? (shippable product(s))<br/>
None..? Very basic outline and displays all information instead of user log in info.<br/>
*	Did you have any task volatility, and what was the cause?<br/>
Trying to understand user sessions, tempdata and displaying tables took a lot of time and prevented any movement in the project.<br/>
*	What would you do differently knowing what you know now?<br/>
I would make the sprint tasks more achievable. I originally created the sprint to complete the project. I would make smaller tasks.<br/>

*	Did you complete all items in your sprint plan?<br/>
Yes, I made the tasks easier to finish within a week.<br/>
*	What is your sprint deliverable? (shippable product(s))<br/>
Data now populates to Checkings, Savings, and Debt but not according to the authenticated user.<br/>
*	Did you have any task volatility, and what was the cause?<br/>
Not really because I want to finish the foundation, like the tables and data, before going deeper into authentication and authorization.<br/>
*	What would you do differently knowing what you know now?<br/>
I believe having smaller tasks helped achive more til week because its less overwhelming and gives more direction.<br/>
