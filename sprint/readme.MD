•	Did you complete all items in your sprint plan?
No, the tasks I made were too big for me to learn and implement in a few days
•	What is your sprint deliverable? (shippable product(s))
None..? Very basic outline and displays all information instead of user log in info.
•	Did you have any task volatility, and what was the cause?
Trying to understand user sessions, tempdata and displaying tables took a lot of time and prevented any movement in the project.
•	What would you do differently knowing what you know now?
I would make the sprint tasks more achievable. I originally created the sprint to complete the project. I would make smaller tasks.
